      "One day, they go to the park. They bring their toys. They find a hill. They want to race their toys down the hill. Lily says, \"My tank is faster than your car. It can go over rocks and grass.\" Tom says, \"No, my car is faster than your tank. It can go \n",
      "Row 260: Vroom!\" They start to race. They push their toys. Lily's tank goes very fast. It zooms past the rocks and grass. It reaches the end of the hill. Lily says, \"My car is the best. It can go over rocks and dirt. My tank is the best.\" Tom's tank says, \"No, my tank is the best. It can go over rocks and dirt. It is the best.\" They keep racing their toys. They do not care about the hill. They are having fun. But then, something bad happens. Lily's car hits a rock. It flips over. It lands in Tom's car. Tom's tank breaks. It falls off. It makes a loud noise. Lily's car stops. It does not move. Lily is sad. She says, \"Oh no, my tank is broken. I worked hard on it. Now my car is broken.\" She cries. She says, \"I'm sorry, Tom. I did not mean to break your car. I was just playing. Your tank is not broken. It is just old. It is not fun to race. It is boring.\" Tom is sorry. He says, \"I'm sorry, Lily. Your car is not boring. It is just different. It can still go fast. It can still go over rocks and dirt. It can still be fun to play with. It is a good car. I like it. I like it too.\" They hug each other. They say, \"We are friends. We are friends. We like each other. We can share our toys. We can have more fun.\" They smile. They play with their toys. They have fun. They are happy.\n",
