API says error should be thrown when mask and is_causal=True is set, but no error is thrown.~~ (confirmed working. error is thrown when mem_efficient_sdp is disabled. otherwise it applies both causal masking AND the mask applied meaning the only values attended to are the ones that neither mask blocks)\n",
