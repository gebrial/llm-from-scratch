When his mom arrived he said, â € That ' re much more safe than eating the bike in a puddle! â €™ Jack was happy he listened to her and rode around the bike, but now he was even happier because the bike had been so fun and not a puddle!

Alice was happy too and thanked Ben with a big hug before she ran out to show him what was in her new present. Ben and Alice played with their toy together for the whole week.

"Alice walked into the kitchen and saw Ben who was looking for something but looked frustrated. She said, ""Ben, why are you","so upset? I want a snack!"" "" Oh no,"" Ben said. He was so upset that Alice was so frustrated she started to cry even more and more. Alice was so upset she ran out the front window to look for a snack, when all of her sudden the sky filled in the sky and it was full with rain. She ran to the kitchen to find something to drink and she found some juice in a bowl on her kitchen table! She quickly drank her snack and it tasted so good! Alice felt better after her drink. From now onwards, whenever she felt frustrated she just had to look for a drink, she would remember the time she was worried and she would always be sure to check on her cup before she went outside."
"Alice walked into the kitchen and saw Ben who was looking for something but looked frustrated. She said, ""Ben, why are you","so frustrated?"". "" Because it ' s a big, juicy melon,"" Ben replied sadly. "" I ' ll help "". He reached for the melon and tried it, but it wouldn ' t come loose. Alice laughed and asked him to give the melon a bit harder to hold. Ben smiled again. "" It ' ll make it fit,"" Alice suggested with an idea. She took two slices of apple slices of melon and handed them to Ben, and said : "" Try it and it ' will make you happy "". But the pieces were still not the right fit. Ben was getting impatient, and he kept asking for more pieces, but he was too frustrated. He just kept on trying and eventually he gave the pieces of melon to Ben and he happily took the rest!"

Alice said, "" What â € of the thing? â €™ Her mom said â € That box has a special power that can help you find the power of your mommy. â €™ Ben said â €™ I can help you, but you have to promise to be very patient and wait until she finds it. â €™ Ben nodded his agreement. His mom said, â € œ Let â € She went to the kitchen to look and found a big, round box with something inside that said ' s the power to find the special light inside. She handed it over, and inside the box was an even brighter surprise. She opened up the light and inside were two big boxes. Ben smiled with relief. â € I knew that his mommy was right. I was patient, â ‚ â € and now she was ready to find the special power of her mommy â €™."
"Alice walked into the kitchen and saw Ben who was looking for something but looked frustrated. She said, ""Ben, why are you","frowning?"". Ben said nothing but looked sad. He didn ' t understand why he couldn â €™ t understand. He just kept looking at the table. Alice tried to explain that he was looking at something in the corner. Ben still didn â € ” so Alice said, "" Let â € œ I know why. It ' ll be fun to find a way to help you "". Ben thought for a minute and finally said "" Okay!"" The next day Alice and Ben went outside and found a box. They opened it and inside was an ice cube! It was cold and round and looked just right for Alice to touch.

"Alice walked into the kitchen and saw Ben who was looking for something but looked frustrated. She said, ""Ben, why are you","feeling this?"" He looked around, and then replied, "" I don ' t know. What are you looking for?"". Alice replied sadly. She had just found something special and she wanted something to show him. Ben was curious so he asked her, â € œ Do you know why you need something? â € Alice said she had a question for Ben. Ben thought it sounded fun, but he didn ` up a bit and he was still frustrated. He said, "" I don â €™ ve ever asked for something that was so hard to understand "". He said he wanted to know more. He said it was too easy, so she asked if he wanted something else instead of asking. He thought and then she said she had an answer. He was surprised. Alice was very proud of him and she gave him a hug, saying that he had learned an easy lesson about not giving in and that it â €™ ll always be worth more than trying something new and not giving it too much."

He decided that if the birds weren ` a good bird he should try to fly up the tree, but it might not be easy to do. So, the bird decided to take matters into its heart. The mouse flapped his little paws and tried his best. After some time of flying and flapping his little legs he eventually made it to up the top. The birds cheered, "" You ' ve made a wonderful new friends, and you ' ve been brave!"" The little mouse smiled and thanked his friends. The birds were so happy to see the mouse so brave. The mouse learned a valuable moral lesson : no matter how scared he may be, if he takes courage and try something that is impossible, he should never let it stop him. The moral of this is to be brave even if you ' ve a bit of courage and try new challenges. You can achieve your goal and be brave with what you do, even in difficult times! The mouse thanked the bird and promised himself he would always try his hardest and be brave enough to try something."

So, he decided he would try and stay in one of them, and he stayed with his friends, who taught them how to be brave. They taught him that if you are brave and strong, then you can do anything. He learned how it is good to stay in your heart. The little mouse was happy, and he was so proud that the other animals had learned his valuable lessons."

The mouse felt very sad, so he tried again, "" Maybe I can try again tomorrow. But I ' ll just try not!"" The next week later that day the mouse was walking through his house, when the wind suddenly started to pick the mouse up! He ran as quick as he can, but it was no match for his tiny body. He looked back and saw his tree was still standing tall. "" What ' s going wrong?"" he said, "" My tree won â ‚ at us and I won! â € The birds looked at him, surprised. "" Don ' ve you ever get so weak? â €™ re you sure you ' d be okay? We just wanted to say hi! We thought you would like to have a good home."" But the little brown bird was so sad, he couldn ' t help it, he was too weak and weak for it to stay strong and safe. And with a heavy head, it was a sad ending for all of the little mouse. He never forgot how his tree was strong, and he never forgot the bad feeling of being too weak."

She brought them some cookies and asked",", "" What is that noise? Can I play a game with your guns, Tim?"" Tim and Jake looked around and did not see Mrs. Lee ' clock. They thought it was funny and fun to pretend. Sam said to them in a low and polite tone, "" You can play with our gun for a while, but be gentle with it."" Tim agreed with Mrs, Mrs. Brown and went back inside with Sam. They pretended they had a mission in their pretend battle and had to shoot their gun at imaginary monsters.

Tim and Sam were curious and wanted a treat. Mrs. Johnson was very kind to him, but they did not want her to be sad. She had some old toys, a big box, a soft pillow, but she did not like the old ones, but she liked her old toys more. They were very old and fragile. She said they could not have a toy pistol to keep them from being too rough and not too old for them. She said she was a good and kind girl, because they had many toys and clothes to keep her safe and happy. "" But we don ` t need new things, Mr. Johnson. We have a new game to play,"" she suggested. "" What game? How do you want to pretend to be soldiers or heroes or astronauts?"" Tim asked, feeling sorry for Mr, neighbor, and Mrs. Johnson. They did the same with a different game, and then had another plan. She took their toys to their room and put the gun in a corner, where they had no other game to shoot or hide them. She said they could play with the old cars instead of a toy gun or a toy sword or a toy gun that could make noises and move. She said she would teach Tim and Sam a game, if she was good or bad. She gave them each a cookie and told him they were the best spies ever. Tim was happy with his new toy, but Mrs Johnson was not happy either. She said he had to do his job and be quiet and not play with them until they were good and good. Tim and Sam felt sad and ashamed.

He walked over, and showed them how he used his toy gun and the toy guns. Tim, Sam and Mr. Lee were amazed. He had never seen a gun before, and they wanted a gun and some candy too. They thought he was very clever. He asked if he could join the games, and Sam, and Mr Brown nodded. She said yes, he could join the games with them, but he had to be careful not with them. She gave them a cookie, which were very yummy. Mr, Mr, Brown, and Mrs. Brown enjoyed the cookie, but then it got dark. They had to say goodnight to Mrs Brown.

Tim had the best time with his friend, but Sam had a different opinion about guns, but she was not. Sam was very jealous of Tim and wanted to show him that she could do whatever he liked to do and have a good life. When it was their turn to go to the backyard with Mrs. Lee ' s dog, they sneaked out and started to play again.

Tim cried and ran away with Mrs, mean neighbor and the animals and the animals. Sam was left all the toys and no one could help them with their fight. The end!

Ben puts the rock - coin on the sand and holds on to it with the coin in it. They are happy and hungry, but also a small dog. The dog is sleeping under the sun, when they wake. He is very tired. The dog wakes him and barks at the children. He is very hungry too and wants a snack. The children are surprised. The children laugh. They see a man walking towards them. The dog is wagging and wagging his tail more gently, when the dog is not moving. He looks happy and playful. "" Look at him!"" Ben and Anna call out, waving their arms to the owner. "" He likes us and he is a pirate dog!"" The man looks surprised. "" Oh, he must like you!"" He says in his dog voice and wags again, as he walks away from the children. "" He is a very nice pirate dog!"" The children giggle. They are happy to meet him."
"Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They like to pretend they are pirates and look for treasure in the sand. They have a big bucket and a small shovel. They dig and dig and find many things: a shiny stone, a red feather, a broken toy car.
""Look, Anna, I found a gold coin!"" Ben says, holding up the stone.
""Wow, Ben, you are so lucky!"" Anna says. ""Maybe we can buy","some ice cream or a toy!"" She puts some money and a coin in her hand. "" We are rich!"" She smiles and gives Ben some money. They run to the shop with some coins in their hand and buy ice creams and cookies. Then they run back and give the coins back. "" Here, Anna. You are my friend and this coin."" Ben gives her the coin. He puts his coins on his hand. "" Wow! This is a good treasure!"" Ben says and gives the money. They are happy and hungry after their game of play with their coins, but then it gets cold outside and it gets dark. They hear their moms calling and say it ' was getting cold outside, kids! They put on the coat, hat and coat, and go to the house with the bucket and the coins in the car and some snacks for their mom. They have a fun day in the park and playing with each other and the coins."

""Wow, Ben, you are so lucky!"" Anna says. ""Maybe we can buy","something for our ship!"" She looks for something to add. "" Maybe we can make it into our ship!"" She runs around with her stick, but she is clumsy and drops the stone on her dress and dress. The stone falls off the bucket and breaks into pieces on Ben. "" Oh no, Ben, what are you going to do with the broken stone?"" she cries. "" I ' ve ruined our pirate necklace, and we can ' ve been very clumsy and hurt!"" Ben shouts, feeling sorry. "" We ' re just having so much fun, and now it looks even better."" He runs to his ship, but it ' s broken. The sand and shells are everywhere. Anna and her mom come over and see the mess. They are very upset and sad, but also angry at Ben for ruining their game and the mess they had. "" Ben, what did we make, Anna?"" Ben says in his voice, pointing at the sand on Anna and her dress. He feels very sorry for being so clumsy, because he had made his ship too big. "" Anna did you do that, and I didn ' t mean to, and I ' ll tell your mom, but you have ruined our game. How do we make another one? And then the park, when you ' ll know what happened?"" their mom asks, in an angry tone. She picks up Ben and Anna and walks away. She hopes their mom doesn ' t notice, but they know they are not in danger either. They hug each each others tightly and say sorry again and hope their dad can fix the park and make them feel better."
"Tommy was grumpy. He did not want to go to bed. He wanted to play with his cars and trucks. But Mommy said it was time to sleep. She gave him a hug and a kiss and tucked him in with his pillow.
""Good night, Tommy. I love you,"" Mommy said.
""Good night, Mommy. I love you too,"" Tommy said. But he was still grumpy.
He lay in his bed and looked at his pillow. It had a picture of a mail truck on it. Tommy liked","trucks, but not all trucks. He got up from his pillow again and tried the letter. But the letter was stuck. He pulled harder, and the envelope ripped. He heard the sound of a beep, but not the words either of them out loud. He got out and ran to his bed, hoping the mailman could hear him. He hoped he was not so bad after all, and he fell asleep with his pillow still on."

He lay in his bed and looked at his pillow. It had a picture of a mail truck on it. Tommy liked","trucks, but not the one that made him happy. He wished his teddy had the same truck that he had seen. Suddenly he heard his teddy cry. It was his teddy bear. He looked at his pillow. He had an urge to cry too. Tommy got up. "" Don me teddy. It ' t hurt. It makes you happy. You have a big heart. I want you to be my friend,"" Tommy said. "" Do it hurt?"" Mommy nodded and hugged Tommy again. "" Yes, I want you, Tommy ' ll be okay,"" Mom whispered back. She smiled and tucked the pillow under her pillow. "" I will see you soon,"" Mommy said softly in her arms again and tucked the pillow under the covers. "" I love your teddy bear too, Tommy. It will always make me feel happy."" She turned off his light. She kissed the pillow gently on the teddy ' face, making it soft. "" There. It ' m not bad, Mommy. You ' re a very good brother,"" Mommy whispered in Tommy. Tommy smiled too. "" I love him, too, mommy. Can I sleep now? Can we go to the living room now?"" He asked. "" Of course, Tommy,"" mommy said, kissing him on her forehead and tucking his in her lap. She kissed Tommy and kissed his head on his head again. She closed the teddy bear and left the door ajar for him to play with his toys again later that day. Tommy snuggled with Mommy on her lap, happy that she had a good night and a loving brother."

He lay in his bed and looked at his pillow. It had a picture of a mail truck on it. Tommy liked","trucks. He wondered who sent the mail truck to and where the mailman would get it. "" Hello?"" he whispered. He hoped it would be the mail. But the mail did something. The truck had no mail truck. It did not drive to Tommy ' room or to his bed. "" Tommy. Where is my truck?"" he cried louder than Mommy. "" I ' ll get it. You can ' t get the mailman,"" his mom whispered back. She got out and went to Tommy and gave him his pillow and a pillow. "" Here, you can keep the truck and the truck. They will be here soon. And maybe the mail man will give it and say thank you,"" she said. Tommy looked up. It had no name and he did not want to lose the mail. He felt a bit better and a little less angry. "" Okay, Mommy,"" he said. He took his teddy bear and hugged it tight. He felt better now. He closed the door and went back to sleep with his pillow and truck in the corner. He dreamed that he could get the truck and the truck to the mail man and get mail the mail truck and mail them to him someday, when they got home from work and mailed it to Mommy. He hoped that the mailman would be nice and give him a letter. He hoped he was a good man and a nice person who would get the letter and mail him."

He lay in his bed and looked at his pillow. It had a picture of a mail truck on it. Tommy liked","trucks. They had a big red bow. They made loud noise when they drove. He liked the truck a bit of gas. He wished he could go to sleep. But then he saw his teddy bears on the floor. They were his teddy bears, but they were all over the floor too. Tommy smiled a lot. He picked them up gently with the pillow and hugged them tight again. They made a funny sound, but they were still cozy in his arms and teddy. Tommy closed his mouth again and fell fast on the pillow again and made a happy noise. "" Vroom vroom!"" he shouted as he woke them. He looked at Mommy with a happy grin and a wink in his eye too!"

He wished Mommy would let me sleep and read him stories with him. But he could only think about it. And the mail did have a letter. Mommy wrote that the letter said "" To Grandma "" with love "". Tommy felt sad. His tummy hurt and his throat hurt a bit. He did not understand what Mommy was saying. Maybe it had a secret letter for him and his teddy. He wondered if Mommy was coming soon and would be happy. He decided he would try the mail and find it. He got out from bed his pillow bed. He put his teddy and his truck in a box. He got out from the pillow. He walked to Mommy and gave her his teddy bear and her teddy. He smiled at them and gave him a kiss. Mommy was surprised. She opened a box. She saw a big envelope. She read it and read what was written inside the card. She read some letters and wrote some letters. Tommy listened to her read. She felt a tear roll in his nose and her nose. He looked in her mirror again and saw Mommy smiling. She looked surprised too, too. She said, "" Tommy, you did it! You are a very good writer! You read the mail! I am so proud of you. Now, it ' m time for you and Mommy to sleep with us. Good dreams, Tommy!"" She hugged Tommy again and kissed her on the nose and the hug. Tommy closed the box and fell asleep with a teddy bear. He felt warm in the box and felt safe. He closed his mouth. Mommy kissed him good night and turned off his pillow to read her the first letter and say goodnight. She kissed his teddy bear good night.

They go back home. Tom and Lily are still happy with the vehicles. But then, Tom sees something else on the street. It looks like a big red ball with lights on top of its back. It is very pretty and round too. "" What do you think is this? Is this your ball? Can we trade it?"" He wonders. It is a red ball. He wants it. He picks up the green car and shows it. It has a tag on the side that says "" Sam "". He likes balls, so he gives it to Mia. She smiles at his car. She likes the ball. They swap the ball for the green one. It makes them laugh too. They play and have more fun. They do it all the same. The end."

"Ben and Mia were eager to ride the subway with their mom. They had never been on a subway before. They wanted to see the big trains and the tunnels and the people.
Mom bought the tickets and they went to the platform. They saw a subway coming. It was loud and fast. Ben and Mia held mom's hands. They waited for the subway to stop.
But the subway did not stop. It zoomed past them. Ben and Mia were","sad again. Mom hugged Ben and Mia. They tried to be brave and not cry anymore. They waited and hoped the subway did not hit them again, but they were still excited to ride on the big subway with the people. They wondered if there would ever happen on the big train and go on it again someday. They hoped the train was going on a trip too soon. But they never did find a ticket. They were too busy watching their mom. They did nothing. They did have a big dream that was on the train that went on an unknown place with the people. They did not see anything. They only dreamed about the train and how it could stop them. They were not ready to be on a subway anymore, they were going on the big adventure with the people. The train stopped at a big station. The doors opened. Ben and Mia looked at their eyes. They did have to get out of the train and walk on. The doors opened. The train stopped. They got on a big plane. It was shiny and red. Ben was scared. He did something bad to happen. He cried and screamed. Mia was scared and sad and scared. They wanted mom and the people. They wanted mom and the train to come back and help Ben, but the people on it were not there. They had to find their seat, but they did not know what to do with Ben. They did. They cried and screamed and screamed and kicked. But no one could find Ben and mom and Mia and their seat belts. The subway was empty. The subway was not fun. It had many cars and buses and people. The subway had stopped at a big station, but it was not safe. There was no one there to save their seat and the people and the cars, but they could only see their mom and the people. They had gone on an unknown journey and they had no one with their mom or the train. They had no hope or dad were too far away or safe."

Mom got off the bus and looked around. Ben saw a big train. She was happy and excited too! They ran to the train and waited. The doors opened. The train was on and they could go inside. Mom took them to the seats and buckled them up on the seat belts. She gave Ben his teddy bears to hold. Ben and Mia smiled and thanked mom for the train. Then mom said, it would take some people on their subway. Ben and mom said, "" You ' ve been very brave today."" They looked around. Ben saw the subway. The people were on. He waved at the people on the platform too, hoping the subway would stop soon. Mom said they could, if he was good and stayed close by the platform and stayed close by. They waited and talked. Ben and Mia hoped the train would be okay, because it was not too late now. They hoped the people would not see their mom and the people on their subway again soon."

But you will have to learn new things and have more space. You are still a good and curious girl. I will be back soon."" Mom kissed him. Ben smiled, and said, thank You, Mom. They waited for their seats and waited for the subway again. They hoped the big train would stop soon, and the people would come. They got on the big bus. The train went up and left a trail behind. They saw many cars on the tracks and buildings, but none. Ben saw something shiny on the ground, and ran to pick it up. It is an ashtray. It was old and dirty. It had holes and stains and dirt and dirt and bugs. Ben wondered what happened. Maybe someone had put it on the big subway. He thought the big people who owned the big train was very sad. He wanted to tell them, and show his mom. But then, something bad happens. The ashtray broke and the big man got angry. He yelled, but Ben could not hear his voice or his words. The big train stopped and made noises and lights and noises. It was very quiet and quiet, and it did nothing to hear it anymore, or feel anything or hear it. It only saw Ben, the small man. The big train stopped, the big people and their big bus came out again. The people and their big bus were shocked, but not angry either of them, because they had found Ben. Ben and the small man looked scared too. They said, ' We did the right things, but you did not tell the truth or you would tell the big train that you did not know.' They said they would take Ben to a new place to go"
