"Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play pretend. They had a toy gun that made a loud noise when they pulled the trigger. They liked to pretend they were strong heroes who fought bad guys.
One day, they were playing in the backyard when they heard a knock on the door. It was their neighbor, Mrs. Lee, who was very old and kind. She brought them some cookies and asked","them what kind they wanted. Tim said, "" We have a new friend for us, Sam and Tim. His name is Ben and he lives next week, and he likes cookies. Can you bring them for us?"" Sam was happy to share with Tim and Sam and said he was happy for him, but they were also a boy. They decided to play with their own toy gun in the yard instead of their old friends. But they did not see the big hole in Ben, and he tripped and fell. He hurt his knee, which made him cry and cry. He felt a sharp cut on the fence that hurt his arm and it bled very much. He heard his neighbor call him to help him and make sure he had a cut on the leg and he had to be careful. Sam ran over, but it hurt a lot. Tim and Tim were scared, because they knew they did not mean to make him hurt. They ran to the hole in the ground, but the neighbor was too strong and fast. She reached Ben, and grabbed a bandage. She said, "" You are very naughty and rude, boys. I am sorry, I will give you a hug, or a treat, or you will be fine, but only if you want to be safe. Do what I do, or how do you feel?"" She took him away and gave him the toy gun, who was hurt. Sam was sad and sorry too and ashamed for his brother, but also sad and angry. He learned a hard lesson that day : it was wrong that being a hero could make you hurt or others sad, or hurt someone. He wished he had never played a game in his backyard with his brother and Tim again, but this time he would have been more careful and respectful, and kind. He wished he had been nicer, like Ben. The next morning when Sam came back, they were playing with their toy guns, pretending to have fun and laughing. They were happy and safe.

Tim was happy and ran to get some cookies. Sam was worried and thanked him too. He followed Mrs. Lee and saw her sitting on her porch with the cookies in the oven door. She was not sure if they would be good for their guests. She thought maybe Mrs. Lee might not notice the cookies. She decided to wait a few minutes and then took a big bite out and smiled at Tim and Sam for their snack back and the rest. They felt proud that they did something bad and did not need to eat."

She said she would be right back to check on Tim, because the pistol would make her look nice and healthy, but also dangerous and not a real gun. Tim said okay. Mrs Lee gave them a real gun and said they had to be very careful with the real gun, because it could shoot them and hurt their skin or their eyes or skin or their eyes, or their eyes, and the face, but she would not let them touch the gun, because it would make her angry and sad, or if they touched the gun.

She wished her fairy friends would go back to the pond, or play in her own pond, or to the ducks and frogs, but they did not like the fairy ' home and the frogs. She wondered what to do and why she had to leave her friends. Lily thought hard about what she had done, but also she did not want her mom to be mad. She wanted her friends back and family. She had an amazing fairy friend, who would come back to her. The fairy waved goodbye to Lily and flew to the hole, where there were other fairies. They were all different and pretty.

She felt angry too, because Lily ' d been so mean and selfish, not hers. She took the green suit off Lily and said it would make Lily feel bad for being selfish and rude. She took the suit from her and threw Lily into a puddle of dirt. Lily was wet too and cold, so her mom said they were sorry and hugged her back to Lily. Lily was not happy anymore.

Lily told her that she had seen a big hole in the tree. The fairy was very happy that she had a secret and she wanted to show her mom the secret. Mom said she would take the secret, and then the fairy could come back and visit. She told the secret and told her to come with the other fairy. Lily followed mom, who was sitting on a bench.

The hole was very deep, and the ground became very deep. She did not know that her wand was very old and weak, and it was very hard to hold. She started her wand on her head, but she could not see anything. She looked around, but her wand was not moving well. It had a hole in the middle, and she could only hear a loud crack sound inside the castle walls. She was afraid and sad. Where did she get her fairy wand?"" she heard a noise from behind a tree, and she turned around to see. But then she saw something else in front of her, and it looked familiar. It had a big smile on the wall and said "" Hello, I am the fairy fairy. I live here and I am your fairy godmother."" She waved at the wand and said hello back. She was so happy that the hole had changed, that she could now see a fairy inside. The wand was a magic fairy. She said that she was a fairy, and she could help Lily find her wand, if she wanted. Lily said yes and thanked her fairy fairy wand again. The fairy waved her fairy dust and said she would come with her soon. She waved her fairy wand, and Lily saw a beautiful fairy. The wand was pink and shiny. Lily waved and said hello to the fairy, but she did not see her. She was gone. The end. Moral : Do not play in your castle. Be happy and have fun with your wand."

Maybe this will make your hand feel good, or the coin can heal. Maybe we can find a way to fix it and see if we can find something else to use."" He looks at his hand, and he feels a small scratch on his hand. He looks at the stone and says, ' Maybe I have to go home. But can I hold it? I want to see how it can feel.' He tries to hold it in his palm. But he is not very strong, and it hurts a bit when he touches the spot on it, but he cannot touch the toy or touch it with his finger anymore. He feels a pain in it and his hand is too small to hold it. He looks down, and sees that the toy car has no power and it has no light. He sees that his fingers are broken.

They will be happy in your sleep and we can have more adventures."" Tommy thought about what Mommy said. She felt a tickle and she was surprised. She didn ' t know why she did it. "" Maybe it ' s okay. But you have to listen and follow the rules. You can play with your truck and my doll, but not too much,"" Mommy suggested in a softer voice that she would be grumpy too if Tommy didn like it or too. She was firm. Tommy nodded. He didn like Mommy. But he liked her more. And she liked him more too. She was not grumpy anymore and he was happy. She hugged Tommy and thanked Mommy for the pillow, and then she kissed him and said goodnight to the bed and her teddy. "" Good night, my sweetie,"" Mommy whispered. "" I love you.""

I can ' t read it. I ' m too grumpy today, but I can tell you what you like?"" Mommy smiled and kissed Tommy ' cheek again. Tommy looked around and saw his pillow, his pillow and her teddy. It looked like he had been grumpy, too. But it was still a picture of a truck and a picture of himself on the wall, with the mail and the picture of his teddy. He smiled a big smile on his face and closed his pillow and put the letter on the bed. He was not so sad. He was happy to have Mommy ' s friend, and he loved his pillow.

But his pillow was too big for him to hold it and he would cry and scream at the mailman or his truck. He would cry or make noise. He was very angry and very grumpy too. He would cry and scream until Mommy came in and helped his nap on her pillow and pillows. He did it all by himself and in his bed, and he was happy. He did it! He was a bad brother."

My mailbox will open later."" The mail man said. Tommy felt bad. He wished the mail would stop and the mailman. He wished Mommy would let him play with his truck and his friends and his trucks. But Mommy said it would not be fun. The mail was not for playing or eating or playing with Tommy and Mommy. "" Tommy. I don ' t like mail,"" the mail lady said in a high voice, in a deep voice that sounded like a thief. She had a big bag of mail in the back of her hand. She was very kind and friendly.
